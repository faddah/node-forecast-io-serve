- [eb30d34](https://github.com/faddah/node-forecast-io-serve/commit/eb30d34d98becf7b961bbe4ba0f1da62117cb499) Put in appropriate line breaks in console.log() print outs. Error messages from servers forecast.io and geonames.org now correct and consistent. Updated README.md. Regenerated package.json with npm init. (@faddah)
- [dbc400c](https://github.com/faddah/node-forecast-io-serve/commit/dbc400c38c8d9a4a7cf283a756002597caa95b95) minor edit changes to README.md - slice[2] -> slice(2) where applicable. (@faddah)
- [01a7eec](https://github.com/faddah/node-forecast-io-serve/commit/01a7eecbfc658fb883f703ff74966b89cd973d38) Now all working! forecast.js calls everything and returns correct locations from zip-convert.js and zip-forecast.js, with messages in messages.js module. In messages.js, in printForecastInfo(), if returned weather object from forecast.io has a special weather alert, that is now printed out. Included in messages.js for printForecastInfo() functions to convert hPA pressure to more commone U.S. Barometric pressure inHG (inches Mercury). Converted humidity to a percentage read out. Took \'%\' off of final visability rating. Unicode characters (percentage, degrees farenheit, etc.) now work o.k. from command line, just have to check terminal character encoding set to some UTF. forecast.js now has commented out optional code for using forEach() instead of async.eachSeries() module (does not work as well, faster, but not in desired order). package.json updated using npm init. .flowconfig updated to include all *.js files. README.md edited to include all this info, thank you\'s to those who helped, and punched up the instructions on how to run it so they were more clear. (@faddah)
